<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a web developer as you can see, i started off not knowing what i wanted to do but along the way of my journey
  i always had a liking for I.T but specifically coding.</p>

<p>I am 20 years old and a full stack web developer , i love wildlife and nature and use that as my escape from 
  reality.</p>

<p>I am a kind, loving, and caring individual and i once was low on motivation and wanted to give up becuase 
  "it was too hard" and trust me nothing is hard unless you make it that way for yourself. I'll leave this off 
  with a quote and a bible verse.</p>
